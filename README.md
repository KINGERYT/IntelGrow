# IntelGrow
We are a team of four friends passionate about renewable energy. After days of research and experimentation, we created an efficient, reliable energy grid system for storing and using solar power.Our system is now in use worldwide, saving people money and reducing carbon footprints. We are proud of our impact!

We have a website that has integrated a system
that uses various parameters such as the brightness
of the sky, energy collected by solar panels in the
morning, and climate outside, to determine the
optimal amount of energy to be used throughout
the day. This helps to avoid energy wastage or
overuse.

Our website also has an additional feature that
helps users determine the appropriate size of a
plant pot based on various factors such as
weather conditions, sunlight, and time.
Additionally, we have incorporated an AIpowered system to detect the moisture levels
inside the pot and add the necessary amount of
water

We have used python ,arduino , html and css.
